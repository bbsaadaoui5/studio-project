# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Deployment

To deploy this application to Firebase, you will need to use the Firebase Command-Line Interface (CLI).

The CLI is a tool that allows you to manage and deploy your Firebase projects by typing commands into a terminal.

Once you have the Firebase CLI installed and you are logged in, you can deploy your application by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

CI trigger: test run
