# Deploy readiness summary

Date: 2025-10-17

Summary
-------
- Branch: `ci/run-e2e` (pushed)
- Local build: `npm run build` succeeded locally on macOS.
- Local Playwright/axe scans: ran via `scripts/run-axe.js` (Firefox fallback) across priority routes — all produced `audit/*.json` and reported `Violations: 0` locally.

Files changed (accessibility fixes)
----------------------------------
- `src/app/(app)/settings/page.tsx` — added `aria-label` on the settings nav and an `sr-only` page-level `h2` to preserve heading order.
- `src/app/(app)/communication/messages/page.tsx` — added an `sr-only` page-level `h2` to preserve heading order.
- `src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx` — made the logo image decorative (`alt=""` and `aria-hidden`) to avoid duplicate accessible name.

What I ran locally
-------------------
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — no errors.
- `npm run lint` — no build-blocking lint errors.
- `npm run build` — succeeded; Next printed route build output.
- Axe scans (examples):
  - `node scripts/run-axe.js http://localhost:3000/settings --output-dir=audit --browser=firefox --timeout 90000`
  - Produced `audit/axe-report_localhost_3000_settings.json` (Violations: 0)
- Broader sweep (10 routes) also produced `audit/*.json` with Violations: 0 locally.

CI and authoritative checks
---------------------------
- Reason: Local macOS Chromium binary is incompatible; CI runs on `ubuntu-latest` with Chromium and is authoritative.
- To run authoritative, open a PR for `ci/run-e2e` or push to main — CI will run automatically.
- Recommended CI secrets (add in repo Settings > Secrets):
  - `TEST_PARENT_EMAIL` — test account email
  - `TEST_PARENT_PASSWORD` — test account password
  - Firebase config: `FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`, `FIREBASE_APP_ID`

How to open the PR (quick)
---------------------------
- Web: https://github.com/bbsaadaoui5/studio-project/pull/new/ci/run-e2e
- CLI (if `gh` installed locally):
  gh pr create --base main --head ci/run-e2e --title "ci: run Playwright+axe checks (deploy readiness)" --body-file ci/PR_BODY.md

Next recommended actions
------------------------
1. Add the CI secrets listed above in GitHub repo Settings.
2. Open the PR using the link above (or the `gh` command). Let the Actions run.
3. If CI fails, copy the failed Actions run URL and share it here; I will fetch artifacts and triage failures (Chromium differences or auth issues).

Notes
-----
- The node-based axe runner supports programmatic login using env vars; CI will be able to scan authenticated pages when the secrets are present.
- I kept the accessibility changes minimal and conservative to avoid layout regressions.

If you want me to monitor CI, say "monitor CI" and provide the PR URL (or create the PR and tell me). I will poll the run, fetch artifacts, and propose fixes for any CI-only failures.
Deploy readiness checklist

Summary:
This branch (`ci/run-e2e`) prepares Playwright + axe e2e tests and CI workflow to validate accessibility and E2E behavior. Local build and lint steps pass. The branch should be pushed and CI run to obtain authoritative results.

Checklist before deploy:
- [ ] `npm run build` passes (confirmed locally)
- [ ] TypeScript checks pass (`npx tsc --noEmit`) (confirmed locally)
- [ ] ESLint passes (`npm run lint`) (confirmed locally)
- [ ] Playwright E2E + axe run in CI (ubuntu-latest) completes with zero critical violations
  - If violations appear, triage and fix before deploy.
- [ ] Protected routes (parent dashboard, messages, settings) validated with authenticated CI tests or mocked flows
- [ ] No dev-only flags or query parameters remain in app code (e.g., `?dev-auth`) — confirmed
- [ ] Remove or archive `ci/ci-run-e2e.bundle` and `ci/push-run-e2e.sh` after PR merge (optional)

Known issues / constraints:
- Local macOS host's Playwright Chromium binary is incompatible; CI uses ubuntu-latest and will test Chromium there.
- Tests currently support a `TEST_USE_DEV_AUTH` local bypass; remove it after CI is configured with secrets.

Post-deploy monitoring:
- Watch Sentry/telemetry and review user-reported accessibility feedback.
- Run scheduled axe scans for production periodically.

If you'd like, I can prepare a short release note summarizing the changes for reviewers or the deploy checklist in your release process.
